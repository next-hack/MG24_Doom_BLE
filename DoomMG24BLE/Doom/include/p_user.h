/**
 *  Doom Port to Silicon Labs EFR32xG24 devices and MGM240 modules
 *  by Nicola Wrachien (next-hack in the comments).
 *
 *  This port is based on the excellent doomhack's GBA Doom Port,
 *  with Kippykip additions.
 *  
 *  Several data structures and functions have been optimized 
 *  to fit in only 256kB RAM (GBA has 384 kB RAM).
 *  Z-Depth Light has been restored with almost no RAM consumption!
 *  Added BLE-based multiplayer.
 *  Added OPL2-based music.
 *  Restored screen melt effect!
 *  Tons of speed optimizations have been done, and the game now
 *  runs extremely fast, despite the much higher 3D resolution with
 *  respect to GBA.
 *
 *  PrBoom: a Doom port merged with LxDoom and LSDLDoom
 *  based on BOOM, a modified and improved DOOM engine

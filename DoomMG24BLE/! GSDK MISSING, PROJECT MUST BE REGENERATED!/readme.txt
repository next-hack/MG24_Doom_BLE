NOTE! Due to Silabs' gecko SDK license, you must:
- import the project with Simplicity Studio
- Open DoomMG24BLE.slcp
- On the right of "project Details", click on "..." and then "Force Generation".
- This will create the GSDK folder and all the required files.

Note: 
- you must have the correct GSDK installed on your system.

FAILING TO DO SO WILL PREVENT PROJECT FROM COMPILING!
